    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hi, I'm Kelete Vamuyan Dolley commonly known as Key Foreyo. Born on the 10th of April 2006 and rised in Jacob Town Chicken Farm, Monrovia Liberia. Bothering with a unique family, the Abrahimac religion (islam) is my faith. well, that was not a bad one though. My companions best describe me as a person who's passionate to learn and solve problems. I have a strong interest in inspirational and educational topics that enhance learning abilities. Growing up i famalarize mysefl to numerous of skill including painting, drawing, music and more. Started my primary education from the Jeudth Foundation elementary school in Omega, while staying with my grand father Joseph Dolley. After a while in 2013 the Ebola pendemic invided. lot of lives were lost during this tragic period of time. My father traveled to the United States in 2012, when he overheard about the Ebola, he quickly send my mother a couple amount of money and told her to leave with us for Guinea. My stay in Guinea that year was such a wonderful moment, because i went to school to learn some scriptures from the Quran. Schools were attended twice day, the morning was for arabic classes and the evening was for french. i would call myself a billingual because this upportunity made me understood french, as for the english language, i knew that already. In the late 2015, i flew again to Liberia but this time around, my father sent me to his cousin Alhaji Layee Sheriff in Jacob Town. Where i stayed eight years living and schooling, my first school in Jacob Town was Crystal Foundation Resource Center. My acadamic skills paved me a road to becoming the first Mandigo to ever become a Student Council President during my nineth grade in 2021. Since Crystal was juat a junior high school, i could not clamix. The following year my father paid for one of the toughest high school known as Sekou I. Sherif. Well, S.I.S was not bad as well i met Musa V. Kanneh and Abdul rahamn Fofana. Meeting them was a therepy for me because of their hardwork and loyalty, i could not be without them. a big thanks to you guys forever we are brothers even though i did not graduate with them because of my travelling to the United state. Currently, i'm working on myself to be the best version of who i want to be....'
